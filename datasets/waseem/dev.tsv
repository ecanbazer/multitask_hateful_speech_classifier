not scoring fairly is called cheating mkr
i rufuse to watch mkr after seeing kat go through to the next round forget the food may the biggest bitch win @mykitchenrules
i was hoping someone would say let is get kat out we will score a mkr
so kat and andre from mkr just leave a bad taste in your mouth very poor losers that is for sure

oh god all these people that i do not like that i would forgotten about go away zeroteamsleft mkr
kat cunt mkr
no kat is still in the competition get out get out mkr
going through the mkr tweets rarely have i seen the c word used so often

@p @mjg not my field at a guess you can be just as tied to a pseudonym as your real name or even more so

@sschinke as a guess anyways
@tomdcc it is very easy to change your gv
donating blood tomorrow pretty sure that i bleed twitter json metadata at this point
pseudonyms are good own it anonymous is not the same thing what jason wadhwa are promoting would require id home address pay to use
ie things not as open for interpretation such as numeric or boolean data is following is not following etc
@twitter think about how passwords work are they stored in plaintext can the provider easily decrypt them nope
@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea privacy problems also twitter likely would not be storing the number that would be bad
@tomdcc a lot of people do not have cell phones i was one of them for years i only used gv against the idea of disallowing gv
do not worry i am sure no one will be like what a great idea until a dude takes credit for it

@girlziplocked @tarah @hypatiadotca @justkelly ok @ameliagreenhall woww this whole thread
she also claimed that women being angry with wadhwa was worse than the death threats we were getting because we are used to it
@spacekatgal just be careful who you align yourself with she sounds an awful lot like based mom
like thanks for that i never would have known had not so many people on twitter yelled it at me
if you tell me to get one of those weird hexa things i will never talk to you again
no kidding i would love to see more deep storylines especially around women characters
